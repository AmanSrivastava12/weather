WEATHER FORECAST :

How to setup this on your device -
You just need to download this project on your device, and click on the index.html file in order to open the project. In order to make changes to the project, you need to open the downloaded files with any text editor(e.g. VS Code).

Short Summary -
It is a weather forecast web application that keeps track of the entire daily weather forecast information such as Pressure, Sunrise time, Sunset time, Maximum temperature of the day, Minimum temperature of the day, what does the temperature feels like, Wind speed, Wind gusts and the Humidity percentage. The temperatures are available in both Celsius and Fahrenheit values. I have used an API key from OpenWeather API to get all this information and then displayed it.
